# ✨ Shine: A Graphical Endeavor into Experimental Real-Time Rendering

> *An SDL2-backed project designed to explore the boundaries of minimalist shape rendering in a two-dimensional canvas of possibility.*  
> *(Translation: we’re drawing circles with code, baby.)*

### 🚧 Project Status

It is with a calculated and thoughtful measure of confidence—albeit tempered by the humility earned through countless hours spent navigating the pixel-paved trenches of development—that we hereby declare this project to be, in no uncertain terms, **functionally operational within the expected scope of its present iteration**.

To phrase it in more succinct, albeit impassioned vernacular:

> **It’s fuckingly working.**

Yes. After laborious debugging, multiple compilations, and a deeply philosophical contemplation of the segfault abyss, we stand here proud and delighted to proclaim:  
the engine breathes, the window opens, and the circle… circles. 🎉

### 🎯 Intended Purpose

While the current build may appear modest in its presentation—consisting, perhaps, of a single rotating or stationary geometric entity—the architectural foundation upon which it rests has been painstakingly crafted to support future expansions of near-boundless ambition.

Plans include (but are absolutely not limited to):
- 🟡 Abstract Shape Generators
- 🌀 Animated Entities
- 🌈 Dynamic Rendering Contexts
- 🎮 Potential Game-like Interactions
- ✨ And a visual style that might make Picasso's ghost blush

### 📦 Dependencies

- SDL2
- C++ Compiler that vibes with your soul
- A reckless love for low-level graphical madness

### 🧠 Final Thoughts

If you, kind reader, have stumbled upon this repository expecting a polished, production-grade rendering system, allow us to gently redirect your expectations. You are instead witnessing the earliest glimmers of something raw, experimental, and alive—  
a codebase in the delicate yet defiant phase we like to call:

> **“Not done. But doing.”**

With code, with chaos, and with caffeine,
